# The Query Class

The Query class is quick query builder to simplify the process of writing
queries.

## Select Queries

A basic select query.

```php
$query = Query::select('customers');
```

This generates:

```mysql
SELECT * FROM customers;
```

The `Query::select()` method also supports quick definitions of columns,
db connection, order and limits.

### Specify Columns

To specify the columns to select, include the second method parameter as
an array of the column names.

```php
$query = Query::select('customers', ['name','email']);
```

Result:

```mysql
SELECT name, email FROM customers;
```

You can also specify column aliases by utilizing associative array keys:

```php
$query = Query::select('customers', ['FirstName'=>'given_name','email']);
```

Result:

```mysql
SELECT given_name AS FirstName, email FROM customers;
```

### Select with Order By and Limits

The fourth and fifth parameters allow for specification of order by and
query limits.

```php
$conn = Connection::getNamedConnection('myconn');
$query = Query::select('customers', ['name','email','city'], $conn, ['name', 'city'], 20);
```

Result for a MySQL Connection

```mysql
SELECT name, email, city FROM customers ORDER BY name, city LIMIT 20;
```

Result for a SQL Server Connection

```tsql
SELECT TOP 20 name, email, city FROM customers ORDER BY name, city;
```
